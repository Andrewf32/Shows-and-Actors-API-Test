# Shows-and-Actors-API-Test

- Clone project from github <br />
- In the directory you cloned this project, run the command in the terminal "pipenv install" <br />
- After running the install, you will need to initialize the database with the following steps: <br />
    * pipenv shell <br />
    * python (this will open the python interpretor in your terminal) <br />
    * from app import db <br />
    * db.create_all() <br />
    * exit() or ctrl + D to exit python interpretor
    * python app.py (this will start up the server for the API)
